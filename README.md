# Neural Network Charity Analysis: Loan Prediction Risk Assessment

## Overview
My client, Beks, is a data analyst at Alphabet Soup; a nonprofit, philanthropic foundation that has donated more than $10 billion to organizations that protect the environment, improve people's wellbeing, and unify the world. Beks is responsible for analyzing the impact of every dollar donated and vetting potential recipients, to ensure the foundation's money is being used effectively. I am helping Beks build a machine learning model to try and predict which future recipients should receive donations, and which are too high-risk.

### Development
Using the Tensor Flow library for Python, along with our knowledge of statistics and machine learning, Beks and I built a deep-learning neural network model. We used the features in the dataset Beks provided to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. 

Beks received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within the dataset were a variety of metadata about each organization, such as: name, donation application info, and organizational business info such as income, government classification, business sector, and more. 

### Analysis
We were asked to provide three separate deliverables, along with a report of ouf findings. The three steps include:
  • Preprocess Data for a Neural Network Model
  • Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
  • Optimize the Model

## Data Preprocessing Results
**Target Variable:** "IS_SUCCESSFUL" (Whether a particular recipient is predicted to use a donation successfully, or not)
  
**Feature Variables:** "APPLICATION_TYPE", "AFFILIATION", "CLASSIFICATION", "USE_CASE", "ORGANIZATION", "INCOME_AMT", "SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS", 
  
**Variables that were neither targets nor features (and removed from the input data):** "EIN", "NAME", "ASK_AMT", "STATUS"
  
## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
**How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?**
  
**Were you able to achieve the target model performance?**
  
**What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?**


## Summary
<Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation. Links to images are working, and code is formatted and displayed correctly.>
